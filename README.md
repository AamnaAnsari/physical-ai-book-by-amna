# 🤖 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

> **Bridging the Gap Between Digital Brains and Physical Bodies.**

## 📖 About The Project

This open-source textbook is designed to guide students and developers through the transition from **Digital AI** (LLMs, Chatbots) to **Embodied Intelligence** (Robots that interact with the physical world).

Built using **Docusaurus**, this project documents the complete journey of building an autonomous humanoid robot using **ROS 2**, **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models.


## 📚 Curriculum Modules

The textbook is structured into 7 core modules:

| Module | Topic | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Intro to Physical AI** | Sensors (LIDAR, IMU), Embodied AI |
| **02** | **The Robotic Nervous System** | **ROS 2** (Nodes, Topics), Python (`rclpy`) |
| **03** | **The Digital Twin** | **Gazebo** (Physics), **Unity**, URDF |
| **04** | **The AI-Robot Brain** | **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, Nav2, RL |
| **05** | **Humanoid Development** | Bipedal Walking, Balance, Grasping |
| **06** | **Vision-Language-Action** | **OpenAI Whisper**, LLMs for Control |
| **07** | **Capstone Project** | Building the Autonomous Humanoid |
