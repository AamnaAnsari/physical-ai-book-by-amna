# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Bridging the Gap Between Digital Brains and Physical Bodies.**

Welcome to the future of robotics! 🤖 This textbook is designed to guide you through the transition from **Digital AI** (chatbots and models) to **Embodied Intelligence** (robots that interact with the physical world).

:::info 📘 **Course Goal**
By the end of this book, you will be able to design, simulate, and deploy a **Humanoid Robot** capable of understanding voice commands ("Clean the room") and executing them in a physics-based environment using **ROS 2** and **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**.

## 🚀 What You Will Learn

This curriculum is divided into 7 core modules, taking you from the basics of sensors to advanced Vision-Language-Action models.

| Chapter | Topic | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Intro to Physical AI** | Sensors (LIDAR, IMU), Embodied Intelligence |
| **02** | **The Robotic Nervous System** | **ROS 2** (Nodes, Topics, Services), Python (`rclpy`) |
| **03** | **The Digital Twin** | **Gazebo** (Physics), **Unity** (Rendering), URDF |
| **04** | **The AI-Robot Brain** | **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, Nav2, Reinforcement Learning |
| **05** | **Humanoid Development** | Bipedal Walking, Balance, Grasping |
| **06** | **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** | **OpenAI Whisper**, LLMs for Control |
| **07** | **Capstone Project** | Building the Autonomous Humanoid |

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Tech Stack

Before diving in, ensure you have the following ready:

* **Programming:** Intermediate knowledge of **Python**.
* **Hardware:** A computer with an **NVIDIA GPU** (RTX 2060 or higher recommended for Isaac Sim).
* **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended) or WSL2 on Windows.

:::tip 💡 **Why This Matters**
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to screens to intelligence that operates in physical space.
