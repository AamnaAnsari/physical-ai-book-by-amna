# The Digital Twin: Simulation

**Weeks 6-7**

## 🎯 Goal
Create a physics-compliant environment. Before breaking a real robot, we break the simulated one!

## 📚 Key Topics
* **Gazebo:** Simulating gravity, friction, and collisions.
* **Unity:** High-fidelity rendering for realistic interactions.
* **Simulated Sensors:** Testing LIDAR and cameras inside the computer.
